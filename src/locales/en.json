    "Hak": "About Us",
    "Hakack": "Neochiron is a team of innovative and passionate students from Şehremini Anadolu High School, participating in the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition). Our team consists of young individuals who think deeply in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, focus on developing problem-solving skills, and strongly believe in teamwork. Each of our members acts with curiosity and a passion for creating; they use their skills in creativity, analytical thinking, and innovation to solve real-world problems using science and technology. We do not only learn to build robots; we also develop our strategic thinking, leadership, communication, and collaboration skills. As a team passionately committed to success, we focus on pushing our limits and making a difference in every project. As Neochiron, our goal is to use the power of science to add value to society, make learning enjoyable and meaningful, and train the technological leaders of the future.",
